String Matching\n","- **Goal**: Implement direct and fuzzy string comparison techniques to find matches based on textual similarity.\n","- **Tasks**:\n","  - Perform normalization (e.g., lowercasing, removing special characters).\n","  - Use string comparison methods (exact match, substring search, edit distance).\n","\n","##### b. Embeddings Matching Using LLMs\n","- **Goal**: Use the semantic context provided by LLMs to match terms based on their meanings.\n","- **Tasks**:\n","  - Generate embeddings for the textual content of each ontology using models from the Hugging Face Transformers library.\n","  - Calculate similarity scores between embeddings (e.g., using cosine similarity).\n","\n","#### Step 3: Combining and Filtering\n","- **Goal**: Aggregate results from both matching techniques and refine the output.\n","- **Tasks**:\n","  - Combine scores from string and embeddings matching.\n","  - Apply thresholds to filter out matches with low confidence.\n","  - Optionally, use simple structural checks to add confidence to matches (e.g., matched entities have similar parent classes).\n","\n","#### Step 4: Output and Evaluation\n","- **Goal**: Output the alignment results and provide means for evaluation.\n","- **Tasks**:\n","  - Format the output in a structured way (e.g., JSON, CSV) that lists entity pairs and their matching scores.\n","  - If possible, evaluate the effectiveness using known benchmarks or test cases to calculate precision, recall, and F1-score.\n","\n","### Summary\n","The project is centered on creating a practical tool for ontology matching, focusing on textual content using both conventional and advanced NLP techniques. By combining string-based and semantic-based approaches, the framework aims to provide robust alignments that are supported by both literal and contextual text similarities. This dual approach enhances the capability of the alignment process, making it more flexible and potentially more accurate than using only one method."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"bBK54kjvNdOO"},"outputs":[],"source":["# imports\n","import json\n","import rdflib\n","import pandas as pd\n","from collections import OrderedDict, defaultdict"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Hz5lF6zYNdOO"},"source":["**rdflib vs owlready2:**\n","\n","Interchangeability: Given that OWL is an application of RDF, tools that can parse RDF/XML can generally handle .owl files, and vice versa, provided that the ontology-specific constructs are understood by the tool.
